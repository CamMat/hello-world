Lab 01 Versioning Your Work

COLLAPSE
Hi! My name is Cameron Matthews and I will be an incoming freshman this year. I will be majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Cyber Operations. I began to like the realm of IT when I was younger because I was constantly surrounded by it. My dad is an IT manager and my brother is currently serving in the Navy on the IT side. Some hobbies of mine include singing, playing sports and video games, and watching anime.  I have decided to take this class because it fulfills the number of hours I need to maintain my scholarship but that's not the real reason. I truly want to reinforce the knowledge that I have gained after receiving my CCNA certification and have yet to learn about in the world of Cyber. Can't wait to get started!
